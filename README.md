# Basic-Portfolio
Creating a basic portfolio for class using basic html and CSS markup. 

## What I learned

**We were tasked with positioning elements using floats and different position properties.
I enjoyed learning the difference between Position: absolute and Postion: relative. 

**Also adding in multiple files to be linked together was a new obstacle. 

**After this assignment I feel to have a much better grasp on the concept of the "Border-Box". 

**Using padding and margin almost became second nature near the end of this project.
