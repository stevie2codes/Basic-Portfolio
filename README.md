# Basic-Portfolio
Creating a basic portfolio for class using basic html and CSS markup. 

## What I learned

**We were tasked with positioning elements using floats and different position properties.
I enjoyed learning the difference between Position: absolute and Position: relative With 
making the connections between parent and child elements** 

**Also adding in multiple files to be linked together was a new obstacle.** 

**After this assignment I feel to have a much better grasp on the concept of the "Border-Box".** 

**Using padding and margin almost became second nature near the end of this project.**

**Thoughtout the projects ive made over 20 commits, Im overcoming the fear of git version control and
feeling much more comfortable with it**

**Im finding as I work on more projects, I really enjoy the design aspect of the project. Making things pretty
or adding an animation to hover elements has been really fun.**
